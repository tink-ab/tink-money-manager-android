# Finance Overview Sample 

This directory contains sample code that demonstrates the usage of `TinkMoneyManager` Android SDK.

## Prerequisites

1. Follow the [getting started guide](https://docs.tink.com/resources/getting-started/set-up-your-account) to retrieve your `client_id`.
2. Make sure you are an [Enterprise customer](https://tink.com/pricing/) with permanent users enabled.

## Configuration

Before running the sample project, you need to configure the following:

1. Set up a configuration object with your specifics:

```kotlin
   val config =
    TinkConfiguration(
        environment = Environment.Production, // Or define your own environment
        oAuthClientId = "yourKey", // Your clientId. Retrieve it from console.tink.com,
        redirectUri = "https://localhost:3000/callback" // [1]
    )
```

`[1]` _Note: This is only required if you also use Tink Link in your application. Please follow the [third party authentication guide](https://docs.tink.com/resources/tutorials/tink-link-sdk-android-tutorial#third-party-authentication) to set this up.
Otherwise, this can be just set to `https://localhost:3000/callback` as shown in the sample above. We will be working on improving this setup and making this field optional in the future._

2. Initialize Tink in your application:

```kotlin
   Tink.init(config, applicationContext)
```

## Running the example app

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Press the run button. If all went well, this should launch a simulator with the sample app running.
